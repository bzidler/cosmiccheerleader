Hi there. Let's introduce a few words that can be linked to my activity: powers of observation, perception, perspective, imagination, creativity, inspiration, intuition, perception, foresight, prescience, discernment, awareness.

All these are senses or qualities that I have developped during several years in order to help you analysing your current problems and take important decisions. Of course ultimately these choices will be yours, but by consulting with me you can get a different and new view that may bring a fresh light to your situation. 

Cards, like tarot, are one of the elements that I use to focus on some aspects of the answers we may be looking for.
